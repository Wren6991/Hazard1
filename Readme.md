# Hazard1

A minimal RV32I processor with registers in RAM, for control-plane applications.

This processor continues my conquest of the natural numbers, which started with Hazard2, Hazard3 and Hazard5. Hazard1 has the distinction of being my first RISC-V core with a non-prime number of pipe stages.

Early work in progress.
